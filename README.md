# cs321-project 1
repo for Colby CS321 project 1 - phone voice messaging system

Group memebers: Luhang Sun, Hoang Anh Tran, Sidney Liu

## Project Overview
In this project we outlined the design of a phone messaging system as an add on to the organization-wide phone system. It allows internal users to leave messages to each other when a call is not picked up on time. The design here is only focused on software systems with the assumption that the parent scope of the phone system and hardwares are in place. 

**In this repository we report the following:**

- Use case diagrams (composed using a UML tool): _Use Case Diagram.pdf_
- Scenarios for the 4 features: _Use Case Scenarios.md_
- Sequence diagrams for the 4 features: under the sub-folder _Sequence Diagrams_, with each _.pdf_ file outlining the sequence diagram for each of the features (accessing account, retrieving message, deleting message, leaving a message)
- Class diagram of the entire system: _class diagram.pdf_

## Extensions
**We did (or have tried to do) the following extensions for this project:**
- A simplified version of Software Requirement Specification for the system using IEEE template: _srs_proj1-ieee.doc_. We tried our best effort to comply to the template and include as much information as possible to the best of our knowledge. However due to our lack of experience still in this professional field, we skipped parts of the template where we found is either out of scope of this project, or not in our current scope of comprehension. 
- Data dictionary
- A new Sequence diagram and class diagram for the Genome SNPs/Indel browser.
